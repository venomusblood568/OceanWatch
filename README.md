## Abstract

**OceanWatch: Revolutionising Ocean Waste Management with YOLOv8**

The OceanWatch initiative, led by IoT OceanCleanse, introduces an innovative approach to monitoring and managing ocean garbage. Leveraging state-of-the-art sensor technology, powered by YOLOv8, the system enables real-time identification and classification of contaminants, providing crucial data to a central hub for informed decision-making. This paper explores the implementation of YOLOv8 in OceanWatch, highlighting its role in facilitating rapid response efforts and reducing environmental damage. Furthermore, the scalability and adaptability of YOLOv8 ensure the effectiveness of OceanWatch on a global scale, making significant strides towards mitigating ocean pollution and fostering sustainable marine ecosystems. Through ongoing research and collaboration, OceanWatch aims to redefine ocean waste management practices, setting a new standard for environmental stewardship and innovation in marine conservation.

## Introduction

The growing concern over environmental pollution, particularly in marine ecosystems, has spurred extensive research into methods for identifying and mitigating sources of contamination. Marine debris and trash pose significant threats to marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Traditional methods of monitoring and managing oceanic waste have proven inadequate. Emerging technologies, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques, offer promising solutions for automated trash detection and characterization.

Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various computer vision tasks. YOLOv8, a notable architecture for object detection, combines efficiency and accuracy, making it well-suited for real-time applications in complex environments. This research proposes a novel approach to detecting and identifying trash in ocean environments using YOLOv8. By training a YOLOv8 model on a dataset of underwater images annotated with trash labels, we aim to develop a robust and efficient system for accurate identification of marine debris.

Our research aims to contribute to marine conservation and environmental monitoring by providing a reliable tool for assessing oceanic trash. By automating the detection process, our system has the potential to streamline waste management practices and mitigate the impact of marine pollution. We seek to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world environments and explore its scalability and adaptability to different regions and conditions.
